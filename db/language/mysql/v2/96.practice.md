## 优化案例

### 1.limit 大数

1. 原因

   - limit 100000, 20 的意思扫描满足条件的 100020 行(回表的){**可以查看 sql 的读取数据页的数量**}, 扔掉前面的 100000 行, 返回最后的 20 行
   - 大量的时间都花费在随机 IO[回表]上

   ```sql
   -- limit 大数: 慢 & 污染buffer pool
   select index_name,count(*)
   from information_schema.INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE
   where INDEX_NAME in('val','primary') and TABLE_NAME like '%test%'
   group by index_name;
   ```

2. 解决方案

   - 过滤掉前面的 10w 行, 只取 20 行: 不是很好
   - **利用覆盖索引, 省去回表的耗时: 写子查询去确定边界**
   - 也可以在业务允许的情况下, 限制页数

3. sample

   ```sql
   -- 慢 & 加载了很多热点不是很高的数据页到buffer pool, 会造成buffer pool的污染, 占用buffer pool的空间
   SELECT id, title, ico, create_time, create_user
   FROM article_copy1
   where `status` = '1'
   ORDER BY id DES LIMIT 100000, 10

   -- solution01: 将上一次的最大的id传递给前端
   SELECT id, title, ico, create_time, create_user
   FROM article_copy1
   WHERE `status` = '1' and id < 2155652
   ORDER BY id DESC
   LIMIT 10;

   SELECT id, title, ico, create_time, create_user
   FROM article_copy1
   WHERE `status` = '1' and id >= (SELECT id FROM article_copy1  WHERE `status` = '1' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 100000, 1)
   ORDER BY id DESC
   LIMIT 10
   ```

## sample

1. create table

```sql
create table db_test03(
  a int primary key not null auto_increment,
  c1 char(10),
  c2 char(10),
  c3 char(10),
  c4 char(10),
  c5 char(10)
);

insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('a1','a2', 'a3', 'a4','a5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('b1','b2', 'b3', 'b4','b5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('c1','c2', 'c3', 'c4','c5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('d1','d2', 'd3', 'd4','d5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('e1','e2', 'e3', 'e4','e5');
```

2. create index

```sql
select * from test03;
create index idx_c1_c2_c3_c4 on test03(c1, c2, c3, c4) ;
```

3. `=`

```sql
-- show index from db_test03;

-- type: ref ref: const,const,const,const extra: null
explain select c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 from db_test03 where c1 = 'a1' and c3 = 'a3' and c2 = 'a2' and c4 = 'a4' ;
-- type: ref ref: const,const,const,const extra: using index
explain select c1, c2, c3, c4 from db_test03 where c1 = 'a1' and c3 = 'a3' and c2 = 'a2' and c4 = 'a4' ;

-- type: ref ref: const,const extra: using index

-- type:  all ref: null extra: using where

-- type: index ref: null extra: using where; using index
explain select c1, c2 from db_test03 where c2 = 'a3' and c4 = 'a4'
```

4. `> <`

```sql
-- type: range ref: null extra: using index condition: 索引使用了 c1, c2, c3
