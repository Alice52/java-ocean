## job

1. requirement

   - must extands **org.quartz.job**
   - must have no-args constructor

2. get ioc bean in job, without using boot-stater

   - this xxJob is created by quartz job-detail, so it's not singleton
   - if need to obtain ioc bean, we can implement SpringApplicationContext to get `IOC Context` , then get bean

3. variables

   - Job can get args variable passed by Trigger and JobDetail according to JobDataMap
   - Trigger args has higher priority `getMegeredDataMap()`

   - if we define variable in xJob, and there same name args provided by Trigger or JonDetail, then quartz will assign value to it automatically
